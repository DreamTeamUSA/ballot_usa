## üòû The Problem 
<!-- content goes below -->
  The United States faces a significant challenge stemming from a broken political system, where elections are polarized between two parties representing extreme ideologies. This polarization results in legislative inefficiency, hindering the passage of bills and reforms. Moreover, it discourages political engagement as people feel their views are not represented and erodes trust in politicians who prioritize party loyalty over the public interest. Additionally, polarization fuels divisive rhetoric and identity politics, exacerbating social tensions and undermining national unity.

## üìù Summary
<!-- content goes below -->
  The intense polarization in American politics is fueled by several key factors. Firstly, humans have an innate tendency to form tightly-knit groups, leading to in-group solidarity and out-group animosity, which is particularly pronounced in the realm of politics. This tribalism is compounded by the emotional nature of political discourse, where personal animosity towards the opposition  overshadows policy differences, a phenomenon known as "affective polarization." Additionally, the evolutionary roots of human social behavior contribute to the propensity for hostility towards perceived rivals or competitors, further exacerbating political divisions. Media fragmentation and sorting exacerbate these divides by creating echo chambers that reinforce ideological biases and limit exposure to diverse perspectives. In the context of a two-party system, politics is often viewed as a zero-sum game, where one party's victory is perceived as the other's loss, fostering intense competition and deepening partisan tensions. Finally, political leaders and operatives may strategically exploit polarization by leveraging divisive rhetoric and identity politics to mobilize their base and vilify the opposition, perpetuating societal divisions and hindering efforts toward unity.

  Social media has a big impact on how polarized American politics are. It creates echo chambers where people only hear opinions similar to their own. This happens because social media shows us content based on what we already like or agree with. So, if you mostly see one side of the political spectrum on your social media feed, you might not see other viewpoints. This can make people more divided because they're not exposed to different ideas. Also, fake news spread by internet bots on social media can make things worse by spreading wrong information. When people interact mostly with others who share their views online, it can make them feel even more strongly about their own beliefs. In simple terms, social media plays a big part in making American politics more divided.

## ü§î Our Hypothesis
<!-- content goes below -->
  If citizens had an alternative to for-profit social media websites like Facebook and X to engage with politicians, then they would encounter less inflammatory and divisive political information, encouraging more rational decision-making and less political and ideological division.

## üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Key Technical Challenge
<!-- content goes below -->
  Upon completing our Civic Tech project we expect to run into issues like merge conflicts, syntax errors, and fetch conflicts. Merge conflicts are going to be almost unavoidable during the process of creating this project. Although there are ways to avoid it, we will most likely run into it due to lack of communication, or perhaps a team member needs to fix other team members' code and they are far away from each other, thus resulting in a merge conflict. Another issue we see ourselves running into is syntax errors due to us simply forgetting syntax. This is an easy fix because all it takes is a question to a team member, instructor, or even Google. Lastly, the most challenging we foresee is fetch conflicts. Fetching is the most unpredictable part of this project, because there will be multiple of us fetching from the same key, and limitations on the amounts of fetches we could make may serve as an issue. As well as having to search through each API to ensure that we are aware of the different pathways to certain pieces of data for all the news sources we fetch from.
